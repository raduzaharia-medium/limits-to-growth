## WORLD3 IN JAVASCRIPT

_The Limits to Growth_ by Meadows et al. (1972) presented a system dynamics model of the global ecosystem and economy, called World3. The original simulation was written in a language called DYNAMO. The code in this repository is a rewrite of the original, written in 2012, which translated the DYNAMO World3 program into JavaScript. [Here](https://blog.raduzaharia.com/the-limits-to-growth-f88a3bab8bc4) is my article detailing the rewrite. 

You can run the program in a web browser [here](https://raduzaharia-medium.github.io/limits-to-growth/ltg.html).
